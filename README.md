This is a util toolbox that I'm slowly building up.
A lot of it's geared to 2d/3d detection and the KITTI dataset, but it includes some stuff interfacing with comet and random linux utilities I've had to use.

Goal of this util repo is to have a store of functions that are versatile.
As such, I am trying my hardest to keep all the functions/files free of individual use cases.
Individual use cases will be limited to run/ and one_timers/, which likely will be gitignored.
